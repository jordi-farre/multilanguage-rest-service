### Instructions

- Create an application with the language you want.
- Create a POST rest service that accepts a JSON like {"request": "random_value"}
- When a request is received the application should make a POST call to https://httpbin.org/anything with the JSON data received.
- The response of this call must be handled and obtained the values method, origin, and json -> testing.
- The response must be stored in a Sqllite database in a table REMOTE_CALL with columns ID (autogenerated). METHOD, ORIGIN and DATA.
- The REST service must return a JSON like this {"id": 123, "method": "POST", "origin", "127.0.0.1", "data":"request_initial_value".

### Considerations

- The application should be developed using TDD.
- A Java example will be provided.
